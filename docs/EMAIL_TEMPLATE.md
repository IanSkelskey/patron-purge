# 📢 Attention Library Directors: Patron Data Purge Initiative

Dear [Library Directors],

The ILS Steering Committee has decided to take a significant step in ensuring our database remains accurate, secure, and streamlined. To achieve this, we will begin purging outdated patron information that meets specific criteria. This initiative is essential for maintaining clean records and protecting patrons' data.

## 🗂️ Criteria for Purge-Eligible Patrons
Patrons included in this purge meet **all** of the following conditions:
- 🧾 **No bills** on their account.
- 📚 **No lost items** associated with their record.
- 🏷️ **Flagged for deletion**.
- 🕒 **No activity in 5 years or more**.

## 🔍 What Does This Mean for Your Library?
We have created **user buckets** that contain the purge-eligible patrons for each library. Your task is to review these buckets and ensure that no patrons who should be retained are mistakenly included.

### 🎯 Your Next Steps
1. **Locate Your Library's Bucket**:
   - Find your library in the table below and note the corresponding bucket ID.
   - Navigate to the "User Buckets" section in Evergreen and look for the **shared bucket** with your library's ID.

2. **Review the Bucket**:
   - Examine the list of patrons in your library's bucket.
   - **Remove** any patrons who should **not** be purged (e.g., active patrons or those flagged in error).

3. **Complete Your Review by January 31st**:
   - After this date, all patron records left in the buckets will be **permanently purged** from the system.

## 🗃️ Table of Bucket IDs
| Library Name | Bucket ID   |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [Library A]  | [Bucket ID] |
| [Library B]  | [Bucket ID] |
| [Library C]  | [Bucket ID] |

*(Add or replace with your actual library and bucket data.)*

## 📖 Instructions for Accessing and Managing User Buckets
1. **Log into Evergreen**.
2. Navigate to **Circulation → User Buckets**.
3. Use the **Buckets** dropdown to select **shared buckets**.
   
4. Enter your library's bucket ID in the **Bucket ID** field and click **Load Bucket**.
