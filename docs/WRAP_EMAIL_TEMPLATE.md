# ðŸ“¢ Wrap-Up: Patron Data Purge Initiative Completed

Dear [Library Directors] and [Steering Committee Members],

The Patron Data Purge Initiative has been completed. This effort has helped ensure our database remains accurate and secure.

## Summary of the Purge
- **Total Patrons Purged**: 16,060

## Key Points
- The purge buckets have been left in place and should now be empty or close to empty.
- These buckets can be used for the next purge initiative and for placing any patrons that need to be deleted in the future.

## Next Steps
- We will continue to monitor and maintain the database.
- The ILS Steering Committee will determine the appropriate intervals for repeating the purge process to ensure continued data accuracy and security.

For any questions or assistance, please open a ticket in the [Help Desk](https://helpdesk.biblio.org/).

Thank you for your support and cooperation throughout this initiative.

Best regards,
